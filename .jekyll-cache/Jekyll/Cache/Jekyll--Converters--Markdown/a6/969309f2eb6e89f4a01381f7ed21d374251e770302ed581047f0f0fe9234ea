I"†<p>Adam Gosztolai (PI) is awarded an ERC Starting grant for the project NEURO-FUSE!</p>

<p>There is an unprecedented confluence of ideas in AI, neuroscience and cognitive science. Discovering the shared substrates of computation between artificial and neural systems requires inferring quantitative models from neural population recordings distributed brain-wide.</p>

<p>The project will develop the mathematical theory and computational methods to jointly model neural population recordings in multiple brain regions. I dream that will provide a major leap in understanding how the brain composes information across regions to solve complex tasks.</p>

<p>There is also no better time to join the endeavour to build a new interdisciplinary field with many wonderful colleagues in AI, systems and computational neuroscience, neurotech and many more.</p>

<p>If you share my excitement, do not hesitate to start a conversation about whether you would be a good fit for the group. If you are unsure, just ask!</p>

<p>You can also send me your CV and motivation letter directly. I would love to hear from you!</p>

<p>Detailed postings will follow soon.</p>

<h3 id="project-1-from-neurons-to-the-whole-brain-developing-a-unified-computational-model-of-single-neuron-activity-across-multiple-brain-regions">Project 1: From neurons to the whole brain: Developing a unified computational model of single-neuron activity across multiple brain regions</h3>

<p>Thanks to groundbreaking single-cell recording technologies like Neuropixels and Ca+ imaging, we can now record neural activity from large populations of neurons. Yet, these tools are often constrained to local brain regions at superficial or deep layers. Our project seeks to leverage vast single-neuron recordings from the International Brain Laboratory, Allen Institute for Visual Coding, and other collaborators to tackle this limitation. These datasets offer an unparalleled opportunity to link activity at the single-neuron level to whole-brain states, potentially transforming how we understand brain pathologies and bridging the gap between clinical imaging (e.g., fMRI) and laboratory-based cellular recordings.</p>

<h4 id="your-role">Your Role</h4>

<p>You will lead the development of novel machine learning algorithms and advanced signal processing techniques to unify isolated neural recordings into a predictive model that spans the entire mammalian brain. You will be at the forefront of a new era in neuroscience, helping to quantitatively model single-neuron dynamics on a large scale—a feat previously limited to low-resolution techniques like fMRI. Beyond neuroscience, your work will contribute to advances in machine learning theory, especially in the development of large-scale models that capture complex neural dynamics during cognition.</p>

<h3 id="project-2-advanced-ai-models-for-neuroprosthetics-understanding-the-neural-control-of-primate-locomotion-using-foundation-models">Project 2: Advanced AI models for Neuroprosthetics: Understanding the neural control of primate locomotion using foundation models</h3>

<p>Recent advances in brain-machine interfaces have enabled remarkable achievements, from decoding speech in stroke patients to restoring walking in paralysis patients. Yet, neuroprosthetics for walking has relied on repurposing high-level motor cortex activity, designed for complex goal-directed actions, to drive simple, deliberate leg movements. To achieve fluid, natural locomotion, we need to go beyond this and develop a deeper understanding of how cortical neural signals translate into complex, dynamic movements.</p>

<h4 id="your-role-1">Your Role</h4>

<p>You will work on a one-of-a-kind vast dataset of primate locomotion, combining high-density neural recordings from three brain regions with detailed 3D motion tracking data. Your goal is to develop a generative foundation model that simulates primate movement, controlled directly by neural recordings. This embodied simulation will provide a powerful tool to study motor control and improve the design of neuroprosthetics. In the process, you will develop an in-depth expertise to work with neural and kinematic data using advanced signal processing techniques. You will also develop novel ML algorithms and controllers that allow the embedded simulation to generalise across environments. You will be able to significantly further our understanding of motor control and have the possibility to translate our findings into the medical domain.</p>

<h2 id="direction-3-open-ended-project---machine-learning-theory-for-neuroscience">Direction 3: Open-ended project - Machine Learning Theory for Neuroscience</h2>

<p>We are generally interested in recruiting talented candidates who want to push the frontiers of combining physics simulations and ML to model complex interacting systems such as the brain. We have specific expertise in geometric and topological deep learning applied to dynamical systems, which in previous publications we have demonstrated to have a significant impact on representation learning in large-scale neural recordings. We seek a candidate who is motivated to develop an independent theory-driven project that pushes the frontiers of neuro-inspired learning theories and simulations. We are particularly interested in merging geometric deep learning and dynamical systems approaches (e.g., state-space models) with probabilistic generative modelling. We believe that merging these disciplines would provide a novel viewpoint with great potential for the memory, scalability and across-task generalisability of current sequence models. We offer plenty of possibilities to apply these models to large-scale neural and behavioural data from our collaborators. If you have strong mathematical and coding skills and would like to explore how brain-inspired ideas can accelerate modern learning theories, this position is for you.</p>

<h2 id="qualifications">Qualifications</h2>
<p>We are looking for candidates who are highly collaborative and courageous to make discoveries not necessarily in their core training. In all roles, we are looking from a quantitative discipline and desire to learn about other disciplines. We are also looking for motivation to explore large-scale cutting-edge neural and behavioural recordings, primarily in macaques and rodents.</p>

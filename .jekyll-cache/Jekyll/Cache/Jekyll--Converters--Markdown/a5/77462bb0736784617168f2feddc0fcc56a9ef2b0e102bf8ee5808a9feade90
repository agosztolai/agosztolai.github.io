I"Ž<p>Adam Gosztolai (PI) is awarded an ERC Starting grant (1.5m EUR) for the project NEURO-FUSE!</p>

<p>There is an unprecedented confluence of ideas in AI, neuroscience and cognitive science. Discovering the shared substrates of computation between artificial and neural systems requires inferring quantitative models from brain-wide neural population recordings.</p>

<p>The project will develop the mathematical theory and computational methods to jointly model neural population recordings in multiple brain regions. We will strive to provide a major leap in understanding how the brain composes information across regions to solve complex tasks.</p>

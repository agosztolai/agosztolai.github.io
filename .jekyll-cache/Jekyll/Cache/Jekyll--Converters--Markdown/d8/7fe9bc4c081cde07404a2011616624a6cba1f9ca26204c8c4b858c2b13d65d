I"Ï<p>Animal behaviours are vastly diverse, from dexterous leg movements of a fruit fly foraging for food or the acrobatic swing of a macaque between trees. To understand the neural basis of these behaviours, neuroscientists have long been pushing the frontiers to find ways to describe of these motions with increasing fidelity. Early techniques have relied on techniques such as cyclograms, taken using long exposure photographs with stroboscopic lighting. However, technology has progressed immensely and modern neuroscience is increasingly relying on 3-dimensional pose tracking, i.e., by following the coordinates of a set of relevant body parts over time. 3D poses provide a complete description of a movement; using 3D poses the angle of any joint can be computed and any other description can be unambiguously derived. In addition, 3D poses are becoming increasingly relevant because they bridge the gap between the converging advances in biomechanics and robotics.</p>
